## Write a single function to perform the task.

In source file: state_dictionary.py

Implement a class State_dictionary 

The class constructor initializes a dictionary. 
The dictionary shall be exposed as a mutable property called state.  

Ensure that the dictionary contains only JSON serializable values.
Provide a method dumps to serialize the dictionary.
Provide a method loads to deserialize the dictionary.

## Write pytest to verify the functionality.

Pytests should be in a separate file. 
Do not define a test class.  
Tests should be individual functions.
